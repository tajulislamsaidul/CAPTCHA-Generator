# CAPTCHA Generator GUI (Python + Tkinter)

This is a simple Python-based GUI application that generates CAPTCHA images using user-defined or randomly generated text. It uses the `captcha`, `tkinter`, and `Pillow` libraries to create and display CAPTCHA images, making it a great tool for practicing GUI development and understanding image processing in Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

*  Create CAPTCHA image from custom input text
*  Generate random CAPTCHA text (alphanumeric)
*  Display the CAPTCHA image directly in the GUI
*  Simple interface built with Tkinter

## ðŸ§  Why This Code Is Useful

CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are widely used for security purposes to prevent bots from interacting with web forms or automated systems. This project is useful for:

* Learning how CAPTCHA systems work
* Building CAPTCHA datasets for machine learning
* Adding a CAPTCHA step to a Python GUI application (like login/registration systems)
* Demonstrating integration of image generation and GUI in Python

## ðŸ’» Requirements

* Python 3.x
* [captcha](https://pypi.org/project/captcha/)
* [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install captcha Pillow
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Save the Python code to a file, e.g., `captcha_gui.py`.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python captcha_gui.py
   ```
3. In the GUI:

   * You can **enter custom text** and click **"Generate CAPTCHA"**.
   * Or click **"Random CAPTCHA"** to generate a random 6-character code and CAPTCHA image.
